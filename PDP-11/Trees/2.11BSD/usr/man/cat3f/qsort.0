NAME
     qsort - quick sort

SYNOPSIS
     subroutine qsort (array, len, isize, compar)
     external compar
     integer*2 compar

DESCRIPTION
     One dimensional _a_r_r_a_y contains the elements to be sorted.
     _l_e_n is the number of elements in the array.  _i_s_i_z_e is the
     size of an element, typically -

	  4 for integer and real
	  8 for double precision or complex
	  16 for double complex
	  (length of character object) for character arrays

     _C_o_m_p_a_r is the name of a user supplied integer*2 function
     that will determine the sorting order.  This function will
     be called with 2 arguments that will be elements of _a_r_r_a_y.
     The function must return -

	  negative if arg 1 is considered to precede arg 2
	  zero if arg 1 is equivalent to arg 2
	  positive if arg 1 is considered to follow arg 2

     On return, the elements of _a_r_r_a_y will be sorted.

DESCRIPTION
     These functions provide a simple interface between f77 and
     magnetic tape devices.  A ``tape logical unit'', _t_l_u, is
     ``topen''ed in much the same way as a normal f77 logical
     unit is ``open''ed.  All other operations are performed via
     the _t_l_u.  The _t_l_u has no relationship at all to any normal
     f77 logical unit.

     _T_o_p_e_n associates a device name with a _t_l_u.  _T_l_u must be in
     the range 0 to 3.	The logical argument _l_a_b_e_l should indi-
     cate whether the tape includes a tape label.  This is used
     by _t_r_e_w_i_n below.  _T_o_p_e_n does not move the tape.  The normal
     returned value is 0.  If the value of the function is nega-
     tive, an error has occured.  See _p_e_r_r_o_r(3F) for details.

     _T_c_l_o_s_e closes the tape device channel and removes its asso-
     ciation with _t_l_u.	The normal returned value is 0.  A nega-
     tive value indicates an error.

     _T_r_e_a_d reads the next physical record from tape to _b_u_f_f_e_r.
     _B_u_f_f_e_r must be of type character.	The size of _b_u_f_f_e_r should
     be large enough to hold the largest physical record to be
     read.  The actual number of bytes read will be returned as
     the value of the function.  If the value is 0, the end-of-
     file has been detected.  A negative value indicates an
     error.

     _T_w_r_i_t_e writes a physical record to tape from _b_u_f_f_e_r.  The
     physical record length will be the size of _b_u_f_f_e_r.  _B_u_f_f_e_r
     must be of type character.  The number of bytes written will
     be returned.  A value of 0 or negative indicates an error.

     _T_r_e_w_i_n rewinds the tape associated with _t_l_u to the beginning
     of the first data file.  If the tape is a labelled tape (see
     _t_o_p_e_n above) then the label is skipped over after rewinding.
     The normal returned value is 0.  A negative value indicates
     an error.

     _T_s_k_i_p_f allows the user to skip over files and/or records.
     First, _n_f_i_l_e_s end-of-file marks are skipped. If the current
     file is at EOF, this counts as 1 file to skip.  (Note: This
     is the way to reset the EOF status for a _t_l_u.) Next, _n_r_e_c_s
     physical records are skipped over.  The normal returned
     value is 0.  A negative value indicates an error.

     Finally, _t_s_t_a_t_e allows the user to determine the logical
     state of the tape I/O channel and to see the tape drive con-
     trol status register.  The values of _f_i_l_e_n_o and _r_e_c_n_o will
     be returned and indicate the current file and record number.
     The logical values _e_r_r_f, _e_o_f_f, and _e_o_t_f indicate an error
     has occurred, the current file is at EOF, or the tape has
     reached logical end-of-tape.  End-of-tape (EOT) is indicated
     by an empty file, often referred to as a double EOF mark.
     It is not allowed to read past EOT although it is allowed to
     write.  The value of _t_c_s_r will reflect the tape drive con-
     trol status register.  See _h_t(4) for details.

NAME
     long, short - integer object conversion

SYNOPSIS
     integer*4 function long (int2)
     integer*2 int2

     integer*2 function short (int4)
     integer*4 int4

DESCRIPTION
     These functions provide conversion between short and long
     integer objects.  _L_o_n_g is useful when constants are used in
     calls to library routines and the code is to be compiled
     with ``-i2''.  _S_h_o_r_t is useful in similar context when an
     otherwise long object must be passed as a short integer.

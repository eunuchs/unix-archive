NAME
     system - execute a UNIX command

SYNOPSIS
     integer function system (string)
     character*(*) string

DESCRIPTION
     _S_y_s_t_e_m causes _s_t_r_i_n_g to be given to your shell as input as
     if the string had been typed as a command.  If environment
     variable SHELL is found, its value will be used as the com-
     mand interpreter (shell); otherwise _s_h(1) is used.

     The current process waits until the command terminates.  The
     returned value will be the exit status of the shell.  See
     _w_a_i_t(2) for an explanation of this value.

FILES
     /usr/lib/libU77.a

SEE ALSO
     exec(2), wait(2), system(3)

BUGS
     _S_t_r_i_n_g can not be longer than NCARGS-50 characters, as
     defined in <_s_y_s/_p_a_r_a_m._h>.

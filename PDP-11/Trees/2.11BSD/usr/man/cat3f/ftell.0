NAME
     fseek, ftell - reposition a file on a logical unit

SYNOPSIS
     integer function fseek (lunit, offset, from)
     integer offset, from

     integer function ftell (lunit)

DESCRIPTION
     _l_u_n_i_t must refer to an open logical unit.	_o_f_f_s_e_t is an
     offset in bytes relative to the position specified by _f_r_o_m.
     Valid values for _f_r_o_m are:

	  0 meaning `beginning of the file'
	  1 meaning `the current position'
	  2 meaning `the end of the file'

     The value returned by _f_s_e_e_k will be 0 if successful, a sys-
     tem error code otherwise.	(See perror(3F))

     _F_t_e_l_l returns the current position of the file associated
     with the specified logical unit. The value is an offset, in
     bytes, from the beginning of the file.  If the value
     returned is negative, it indicates an error and will be the
     negation of the system error code. (See perror(3F))

FILES

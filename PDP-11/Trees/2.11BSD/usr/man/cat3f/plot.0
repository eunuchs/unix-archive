DESCRIPTION
     These are interface subroutines, in the library -_l_f_7_7_p_l_o_t,
     allowing _f_7_7 users to call the _p_l_o_t(3X) graphics routines
     which generate graphic output in a relatively device-
     independent manner.  The _f_7_7 subroutine names are the same
     as the _C function names except that _l_i_n_e_m_o_d and _c_l_o_s_e_p_l have
     been shortened to _l_i_n_e_m_d and _c_l_o_s_p_l . See _p_l_o_t(5) and
     _p_l_o_t(3X) for a description of their effect.

     Only the first 255 character in string arguments to _l_a_b_e_l
     and _l_i_n_e_m_d are used.

     This library must be specified in the _f_7_7(1) command before
     the device specific graphics library; for example, to com-
     pile and load a FORTRAN program in _p_r_o_g._f to run on a Tek-
     tronix 4014 terminal:

	  f77 prog.f -lf77plot -l4014

NAME
     rcsintro - introduction to RCS commands

DESCRIPTION
     The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
     of text files.  RCS automates the storing, retrieval, log-
     ging, identification, and merging of revisions. RCS is use-
     ful for text that is revised frequently, for example pro-
     grams, documentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc.

     The basic user interface is extremely simple. The novice
     only needs to learn two commands: _c_i(1L) and _c_o(1L).  _C_i,
     short for "check in", deposits the contents of a text file
     into an archival file called an RCS file. An RCS file con-
     tains all revisions of a particular text file.  _C_o, short
     for "check out", retrieves revisions from an RCS file.

     Functions of RCS

     o+	  Storage and retrieval of multiple revisions of text.
	  RCS saves all old revisions in a space efficient way.
	  Changes no longer destroy the original, because the
	  previous revisions remain accessible. Revisions can be
	  retrieved according to ranges of revision numbers, sym-
	  bolic names, dates, authors, and states.

     o+	  Maintenance of a complete history of changes. RCS logs
	  all changes automatically.  Besides the text of each
	  revision, RCS stores the author, the date and time of
	  check-in, and a log message summarizing the change.
	  The logging makes it easy to find out what happened to
	  a module, without having to compare source listings or
	  having to track down colleagues.

     o+	  Resolution of access conflicts. When two or more pro-
	  grammers wish to modify the same revision, RCS alerts
	  the programmers and prevents one modification from cor-
	  rupting the other.

     o+	  Maintenance of a tree of Revisions. RCS can maintain
	  separate lines of development for each module. It
	  stores a tree structure that represents the ancestral
	  relationships among revisions.

     o+	  Merging of revisions and resolution of conflicts.  Two
	  separate lines of development of a module can be
	  coalesced by merging.  If the revisions to be merged
	  affect the same sections of code, RCS alerts the user
	  about the overlapping changes.

     o+	  Release and configuration control. Revisions can be
	  assigned symbolic names and marked as released, stable,

	  experimental, etc.  With these facilities, configura-
	  tions of modules can be described simply and directly.

     o+	  Automatic identification of each revision with name,
	  revision number, creation time, author, etc.	The iden-
	  tification is like a stamp that can be embedded at an
	  appropriate place in the text of a revision.	The iden-
	  tification makes it simple to determine which revisions
	  of which modules make up a given configuration.

     o+	  Minimization of secondary storage. RCS needs little
	  extra space for the revisions (only the differences).
	  If intermediate revisions are deleted, the correspond-
	  ing deltas are compressed accordingly.


     Getting Started with RCS

     Suppose you have a file f.c that you wish to put under con-
     trol of RCS. Invoke the check-in command

	       ci  f.c

     This command creates the RCS file f.c,v, stores f.c into it
     as revision 1.1, and deletes f.c.	It also asks you for a
     description. The description should be a synopsis of the
     contents of the file. All later check-in commands will ask
     you for a log entry, which should summarize the changes that
     you made.

     Files ending in ,v are called RCS files (`v' stands for
     `versions'), the others are called working files.	To get
     back the working file f.c in the previous example, use the
     check-out command

	       co  f.c

     This command extracts the latest revision from f.c,v and
     writes it into f.c. You can now edit f.c and check it back
     in by invoking

	       ci  f.c

     _C_i increments the revision number properly. If _c_i complains
     with the message

	       ci error: no lock set by <your login>

     then your system administrator has decided to create all RCS
     files with the locking attribute set to `strict'. In this
     case, you should have locked the revision during the previ-
     ous check-out. Your last check-out should have been

RCSINTRO(1L)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	     RCSINTRO(1L)



	       co  -l  f.c

     Of course, it is too late now to do the check-out with lock-
     ing, because you probably modified f.c already, and a second
     check-out would overwrite your modifications. Instead,
     invoke

	       rcs  -l	f.c

     This command will lock the latest revision for you, unless
     somebody else got ahead of you already. In this case, you'll
     have to negotiate with that person.

     Locking assures that you, and only you, can check in the
     next update, and avoids nasty problems if several people
     work on the same file.  Even if a revision is locked, it can
     still be checked out for reading, compiling, etc. All that
     locking prevents is a CHECK-IN by anybody but the locker.

     If your RCS file is private, i.e., if you are the only per-
     son who is going to deposit revisions into it, strict lock-
     ing is not needed and you can turn it off.  If strict lock-
     ing is turned off, the owner of the RCS file need not have a
     lock for check-in; all others still do. Turning strict lock-
     ing off and on is done with the commands

	       rcs  -U	f.c	and	rcs  -L  f.c

     If you don't want to clutter your working directory with RCS
     files, create a subdirectory called RCS in your working
     directory, and move all your RCS files there. RCS commands
     will look first into that directory to find needed files.
     All the commands discussed above will still work, without
     any modification. (Actually, pairs of RCS and working files
     can be specified in 3 ways: (a) both are given, (b) only the
     working file is given, (c) only the RCS file is given. Both
     RCS and working files may have arbitrary path prefixes; RCS
     commands pair them up intelligently).

     To avoid the deletion of the working file during check-in
     (in case you want to continue editing), invoke

	       ci  -l  f.c     or     ci  -u  f.c

     These commands check in f.c as usual, but perform an impli-
     cit check-out. The first form also locks the checked in
     revision, the second one doesn't. Thus, these options save
     you one check-out operation.  The first form is useful if
     locking is strict, the second one if not strict.  Both
     update the identification markers in your working file (see
     below).

RCSINTRO(1L)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	     RCSINTRO(1L)



     You can give _c_i the number you want assigned to a checked in
     revision. Assume all your revisions were numbered 1.1, 1.2,
     1.3, etc., and you would like to start release 2.	The com-
     mand

	       ci  -r2	f.c	or     ci  -r2.1  f.c

     assigns the number 2.1 to the new revision.  From then on,
     _c_i will number the subsequent revisions with 2.2, 2.3, etc.
     The corresponding _c_o commands

	       co  -r2	f.c	and	co  -r2.1  f.c

     retrieve the latest revision numbered 2.x and the revision
     2.1, respectively. _C_o without a revision number selects the
     latest revision on the "trunk", i.e., the highest revision
     with a number consisting of 2 fields. Numbers with more than
     2 fields are needed for branches.	For example, to start a
     branch at revision 1.3, invoke

	       ci  -r1.3.1  f.c

     This command starts a branch numbered 1 at revision 1.3, and
     assigns the number 1.3.1.1 to the new revision. For more
     information about branches, see _r_c_s_f_i_l_e(5L).


     Automatic Identification

     RCS can put special strings for identification into your
     source and object code. To obtain such identification, place
     the marker

	       $Header$

     into your text, for instance inside a comment.  RCS will
     replace this marker with a string of the form

	       $Header:  filename  revision_number  date  time
     author  state $

     With such a marker on the first page of each module, you can
     always see with which revision you are working.  RCS keeps
     the markers up to date automatically.  To propagate the
     markers into your object code, simply put them into literal
     character strings. In C, this is done as follows:

	       static char rcsid[] = "$Header$";

     The command _i_d_e_n_t extracts such markers from any file, even
     object code and dumps.  Thus, _i_d_e_n_t lets you find out which
     revisions of which modules were used in a given program.

     You may also find it useful to put the marker $Log$ into
     your text, inside a comment. This marker accumulates the log
     messages that are requested during check-in.  Thus, you can
     maintain the complete history of your file directly inside
     it.  There are several additional identification markers;
     see _c_o(1L) for details.

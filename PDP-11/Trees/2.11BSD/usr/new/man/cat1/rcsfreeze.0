NAME
     rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration of sources checked in
     under RCS

SYNOPSIS
     rcsfreeze [symbolic revision name]

DESCRIPTION
     The _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e command has the purpose of assigning a sym-
     bolic revision number to a set of RCS files, which form a
     valid configuration.

     The idea is to run _r_c_s_f_r_e_e_z_e each time a new version is
     checked in. A unique symbolic revision number (C__n_u_m_b_e_r,
     where _n_u_m_b_e_r is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is
     then assigned to the most recent revision of each RCS file
     of the main trunk.

     If the command is invoked with an argument, then this argu-
     ment is used as the symbolic name to freeze a configuration.
     The unique identifier is still generated and is listed in
     the log file but it will not appear as part of the symbolic
     revision name in the actual RCS files.

     A log message is requested from the user which is saved for
     future references.

     The shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.
     It is important that all changed files are checked in (there
     are no precautions against any error in this respect). Run
     _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1L) first and see whether any sources remain in the
     current directory.

FILES
     [RCS/]rcsfreeze.version  for the version number

     [RCS/]rscfreeze.log      for the log messages, most recent
			      log message first.

BUGS

     checked out and modified.

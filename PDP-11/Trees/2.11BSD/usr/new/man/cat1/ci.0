NAME
     ci - check in RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     ci [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_i stores new revisions into RCS files.  Each file name end-
     ing in `,v' is taken to be an RCS file, all others are
     assumed to be working files containing new revisions.  _C_i
     deposits the contents of each working file into the
     corresponding RCS file.

     Pairs of RCS files and working files may be specified in 3
     ways (see also the example section of _c_o (1)).

     1) Both the RCS file and the working file are given. The RCS
     file name is of the form _p_a_t_h_1/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e,v and the working
     file name is of the form _p_a_t_h_2/_w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e, where _p_a_t_h_1/ and
     _p_a_t_h_2/ are (possibly different or empty) paths and _w_o_r_k_f_i_l_e
     is a file name.

     2) Only the RCS file is given. Then the working file is
     assumed to be in the current directory and its name is
     derived from the name of the RCS file by removing _p_a_t_h_1/ and
     the suffix `,v'.

     3) Only the working file is given. Then the name of the RCS
     file is derived from the name of the working file by remov-
     ing _p_a_t_h_2/ and appending the suffix `,v'.

     If the RCS file is omitted or specified without a path, then
     _c_i looks for the RCS file first in the directory ./RCS and
     then in the current directory.

     For _c_i to work, the caller's login must be on the access
     list, except if the access list is empty or the caller is
     the superuser or the owner of the file.  To append a new
     revision to an existing branch, the tip revision on that
     branch must be locked by the caller. Otherwise, only a new
     branch can be created. This restriction is not enforced for
     the owner of the file, unless locking is set to _s_t_r_i_c_t (see
     _r_c_s (1)).	A lock held by someone else may be broken with
     the _r_c_s command.

     Normally, _c_i checks whether the revision to be deposited is
     different from the preceding one. If it is not different, _c_i
     either aborts the deposit (if -q is given) or asks whether
     to abort (if -q is omitted). A deposit can be forced with
     the -f option.

     For each revision deposited, _c_i prompts for a log message.
     The log message should summarize the change and must be ter-
     minated with a line containing a single `.' or a control-D.
     If several files are checked in, _c_i asks whether to reuse
     the previous log message.	If the std. input is not a termi-
     nal, _c_i suppresses the prompt and uses the same log message
     for all files.  See also -m.

     The number of the deposited revision can be given by any of
     the options -r, -f, -k, -l, -u, or -q (see -r).

     If the RCS file does not exist, _c_i creates it and deposits
     the contents of the working file as the initial revision
     (default number: 1.1).  The access list is initialized to
     empty.  Instead of the log message, _c_i requests descriptive
     text (see -t below).

     -r[_r_e_v]   assigns the revision number _r_e_v to the checked-in
	       revision, releases the corresponding lock, and
	       deletes the working file. This is also the
	       default.

	       If _r_e_v is omitted, _c_i derives the new revision
	       number from the caller's last lock. If the caller
	       has locked the tip revision of a branch, the new
	       revision is appended to that branch. The new revi-
	       sion number is obtained by incrementing the tip
	       revision number.  If the caller locked a non-tip
	       revision, a new branch is started at that revision
	       by incrementing the highest branch number at that
	       revision.  The default initial branch and level
	       numbers are 1.  If the caller holds no lock, but
	       he is the owner of the file and locking is not set
	       to _s_t_r_i_c_t, then the revision is appended to the
	       trunk.

	       If _r_e_v indicates a revision number, it must be
	       higher than the latest one on the branch to which
	       _r_e_v belongs, or must start a new branch.

	       If _r_e_v indicates a branch instead of a revision,
	       the new revision is appended to that branch. The
	       level number is obtained by incrementing the tip
	       revision number of that branch.	If _r_e_v indicates
	       a non-existing branch, that branch is created with
	       the initial revision numbered _r_e_v._1.

	       Exception: On the trunk, revisions can be appended
	       to the end, but not inserted.

     -f[_r_e_v]   forces a deposit; the new revision is deposited
	       even it is not different from the preceding one.

     -k[_r_e_v]   searches the working file for keyword values to
	       determine its revision number, creation date,
	       author, and state (see _c_o (1)), and assigns these
	       values to the deposited revision, rather than com-
	       puting them locally.  A revision number given by a
	       command option overrides the number in the working
	       file.  This option is useful for software distri-
	       bution. A revision that is sent to several sites
	       should be checked in with the -k option at these
	       sites to preserve its original number, date,
	       author, and state.

     -l[_r_e_v]   works like -r, except it performs an additional _c_o
	       -_l for the deposited revision. Thus, the deposited
	       revision is immediately checked out again and
	       locked.	This is useful for saving a revision
	       although one wants to continue editing it after
	       the checkin.

     -u[_r_e_v]   works like -l, except that the deposited revision
	       is not locked.  This is useful if one wants to
	       process (e.g., compile) the revision immediately
	       after checkin.

     -q[_r_e_v]   quiet mode; diagnostic output is not printed.  A
	       revision that is not different from the preceding
	       one is not deposited, unless -f is given.

     -m_m_s_g     uses the string _m_s_g as the log message for all
	       revisions checked in.

     -n_n_a_m_e    assigns the symbolic name _n_a_m_e to the number of
	       the checked-in revision.  _C_i prints an error mes-
	       sage if _n_a_m_e is already assigned to another
	       number.

     -N_n_a_m_e    same as -n, except that it overrides a previous
	       assignment of _n_a_m_e.

     -s_s_t_a_t_e   sets the state of the checked-in revision to the
	       identifier _s_t_a_t_e.  The default is _E_x_p.

     -t[_t_x_t_f_i_l_e]
	       writes descriptive text into the RCS file (deletes
	       the existing text).  If _t_x_t_f_i_l_e is omitted, _c_i
	       prompts the user for text supplied from the std.
	       input, terminated with a line containing a single
	       `.' or control-D.  Otherwise, the descriptive text
	       is copied from the file _t_x_t_f_i_l_e.  During initiali-
	       zation, descriptive text is requested even if -t
	       is not given.  The prompt is suppressed if std.
	       input is not a terminal.

DIAGNOSTICS
     For each revision, _c_i prints the RCS file, the working file,
     and the number of both the deposited and the preceding revi-
     sion.  The exit status always refers to the last file
     checked in, and is 0 if the operation was successful, 1 oth-
     erwise.

FILE MODES
     An RCS file created by _c_i inherits the read and execute per-
     missions from the working file. If the RCS file exists
     already, _c_i preserves its read and execute permissions.  _C_i
     always turns off all write permissions of RCS files.

FILES
     The caller of the command must have read/write permission
     for the directories containing the RCS file and the working
     file, and read permission for the RCS file itself.  A number
     of temporary files are created.  A semaphore file is created
     in the directory containing the RCS file.	_C_i always creates
     a new RCS file and unlinks the old one.  This strategy makes
     links to RCS files useless.

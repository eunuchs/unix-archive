NAME
     rlog - print log messages and other information about RCS
     files

SYNOPSIS
     rlog [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_l_o_g prints information about RCS files.  Files ending in
     `,v' are RCS files, all others are working files. If a work-
     ing file is given, _r_l_o_g tries to find the corresponding RCS
     file first in directory ./RCS and then in the current direc-
     tory, as explained in _c_o(1L).

     _R_l_o_g prints the following information for each RCS file: RCS
     file name, working file name, head (i.e., the number of the
     latest revision on the trunk), default branch, access list,
     locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of revisions,
     number of revisions selected for printing, and descriptive
     text. This is followed by entries for the selected revisions
     in reverse chronological order for each branch. For each
     revision, _r_l_o_g prints revision number, author, date/time,
     state, number of lines added/deleted (with respect to the
     previous revision), locker of the revision (if any), and log
     message.  Without options, _r_l_o_g prints complete information.
     The options below restrict this output.

     -L        ignores RCS files that have no locks set; con-
	       venient in combination with -R, -h, or -l.

     -R        only prints the name of the RCS file; convenient
	       for translating a working file name into an RCS
	       file name.

     -h        prints only RCS file name, working file name,
	       head, default branch, access list, locks, symbolic
	       names, and suffix.

     -t        prints the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.

     -b        prints information about the revisions on the
	       default branch (normally the highest branch on the
	       trunk).

     -d_d_a_t_e_s   prints information about revisions with a checkin
	       date/time in the ranges given by the semicolon-
	       separated list of _d_a_t_e_s.  A range of the form
	       _d_1<_d_2 or _d_2>_d_1 selects the revisions that were
	       deposited between _d_1 and _d_2, (inclusive).  A range
	       of the form <_d or _d> selects all revisions dated _d
	       or earlier.  A range of the form _d< or >_d selects
	       all revisions dated _d or later.	A range of the

	       form _d selects the single, latest revision dated _d
	       or earlier.  The date/time strings _d, _d_1, and _d_2
	       are in the free format explained in _c_o(1L).  Quot-
	       ing is normally necessary, especially for < and >.
	       Note that the separator is a semicolon.

     -l[_l_o_c_k_e_r_s]
	       prints information about locked revisions.  If the
	       comma-separated list _l_o_c_k_e_r_s of login names is
	       given, only the revisions locked by the given
	       login names are printed.  If the list is omitted,
	       all locked revisions are printed.

     -r_r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s
	       prints information about revisions given in the
	       comma-separated list _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s of revisions and
	       ranges. A range _r_e_v_1-_r_e_v_2 means revisions _r_e_v_1 to
	       _r_e_v_2 on the same branch, -_r_e_v means revisions from
	       the beginning of the branch up to and including
	       _r_e_v, and _r_e_v- means revisions starting with _r_e_v to
	       the end of the branch containing _r_e_v. An argument
	       that is a branch means all revisions on that
	       branch. A range of branches means all revisions on
	       the branches in that range.

     -s_s_t_a_t_e_s  prints information about revisions whose state
	       attributes match one of the states given in the
	       comma-separated list _s_t_a_t_e_s.

     -w[_l_o_g_i_n_s]
	       prints information about revisions checked in by
	       users with login names appearing in the comma-
	       separated list _l_o_g_i_n_s.  If _l_o_g_i_n_s is omitted, the
	       user's login is assumed.

     _R_l_o_g prints the intersection of the revisions selected with
     the options -d, -l, -s, -w, intersected with the union of
     the revisions selected by -b and -r.

EXAMPLES
	     rlog  -L  -R  RCS/*,v
	     rlog  -L  -h  RCS/*,v
	     rlog  -L  -l  RCS/*,v
	     rlog  RCS/*,v

     The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
     subdirectory `RCS' which have locks. The second command
     prints the headers of those files, and the third prints the
     headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions.  The
     last command prints complete information.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status always refers to the last RCS file operated
     upon, and is 0 if the operation was successful, 1 otherwise.

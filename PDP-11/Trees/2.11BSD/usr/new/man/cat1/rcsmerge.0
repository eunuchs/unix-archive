NAME
     rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions

SYNOPSIS
     rcsmerge -r_r_e_v_1 [ -r_r_e_v_2 ] [ -p ] file

DESCRIPTION
     _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e incorporates the changes between _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 of
     an RCS file into the corresponding working file. If -p is
     given, the result is printed on the standard output, other-
     wise the result overwrites the working file.

     A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise a
     working file name. _M_e_r_g_e derives the working file name from
     the RCS file name and vice versa, as explained in _c_o(1L).	A
     pair consisting of both an RCS and a working file name may
     also be specified.

     _R_e_v_1 may not be omitted. If _r_e_v_2 is omitted, the latest
     revision on the default branch (normally the highest branch
     on the trunk) is assumed.	Both _r_e_v_1 and _r_e_v_2 may be given
     numerically or symbolically.

     _R_c_s_m_e_r_g_e prints a warning if there are overlaps, and delim-
     its the overlapping regions as explained in _c_o -_j.  The com-
     mand is useful for incorporating changes into a checked-out
     revision.

EXAMPLES
     Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c. Assume furth-
     ermore that you just completed revision 3.4, when you
     receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.	To com-
     bine the updates to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8 and
     3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

	     rcsmerge  -p  -r2.8  -r3.4  f.c  >f.merged.c

     Then examine f.merged.c.  Alternatively, if you want to save
     the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as revi-
     sion 2.8.1.1 and execute _c_o -_j:

	     ci  -r2.8.1.1  f.c
	     co  -r3.4	-j2.8:2.8.1.1  f.c

     As another example, the following command undoes the changes
     between revision 2.4 and 2.8 in your currently checked out
     revision in f.c.

	     rcsmerge  -r2.8  -r2.4  f.c

     Note the order of the arguments, and that f.c will be
     overwritten.

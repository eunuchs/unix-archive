NAME
     less - opposite of more

SYNOPSIS
     less [-cdepstwmMqQuU] [-h_N] [-b[fp]_N] [-x_N] [-[z]_N]
	  [-P[mM]_s_t_r_i_n_g] [-l_l_o_g_f_i_l_e] [+_c_m_d]  [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]...

DESCRIPTION
     _L_e_s_s is a program similar to _m_o_r_e (1), but which allows
     backwards movement in the file as well as forward movement.
     Also, _l_e_s_s does not have to read the entire input file
     before starting, so with large input files it starts up fas-
     ter than text editors like _v_i (1).  _L_e_s_s uses termcap, so it
     can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited
     support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal,
     lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are
     prefixed with an up-arrow.)

     Commands are based on both _m_o_r_e and _v_i. Commands may be pre-
     ceeded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions
     below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.


COMMANDS
     In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.

     h	  Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you for-
	  get all the other commands, remember this one.

     SPACE
	  Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option
	  -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the
	  final screenful is displayed.

     f or ^F
	  Same as SPACE.

     b or ^B
	  Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option
	  -z below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the
	  final screenful is displayed.

     RETURN
	  Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines
	  are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

     e or ^E
	  Same as RETURN.

     j or ^J
	  Also the same as RETURN.

     y or ^Y
	  Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines
	  are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

     k or ^K
	  Same as y.

     d or ^D
	  Scroll forward N lines, default 10.  If N is specified,
	  it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u com-
	  mands.

     u or ^U
	  Scroll backward N lines, default 10.	If N is speci-
	  fied, it becomes the new default for subsequent d and u
	  commands.

     r or ^R or ^L
	  Repaint the screen.

     R	  Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
	  Useful if the file is changing while it is being
	  viewed.

     g	  Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of
	  file).  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)

     G	  Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
	  (Warning: this may be slow if standard input, rather
	  than a file, is being read.)

     p	  Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be
	  between 0 and 100.  (This is possible if standard input
	  is being read, but only if _l_e_s_s has already read to the
	  end of the file.  It is always fast, but not always
	  useful.)

     %	  Same as p.

     m	  Followed by any lowercase letter, marks the current
	  position with that letter.

     '	  (Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase letter,
	  returns to the position which was previously marked
	  with that letter.  Followed by another single quote,
	  returns to the postion at which the last "large" move-
	  ment command was executed.  All marks are lost when a
	  new file is examined.

     /pattern
	  Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing
	  the pattern.	N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a



Printed 11/24/99						2






LESS(LOCAL)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LESS(LOCAL)



	  regular expression, as recognized by _e_d. The search
	  starts at the second line displayed (but see the -t
	  option, which changes this).

     ?pattern
	  Search backward in the file for the N-th line contain-
	  ing the pattern.  The search starts at the line immedi-
	  ately before the top line displayed.

     n	  Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the
	  last pattern.

     E	  Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing, the
	  "current" file (see the N and P commands below) from
	  the list of files in the command line is re-examined.

     N	  Examine the next file (from the list of files given in
	  the command line).  If a number N is specified (not to
	  be confused with the command N), the N-th next file is
	  examined.

     P	  Examine the previous file.  If a number N is specified,
	  the N-th previous file is examined.

     = or ^G
	  Prints some information about the file being viewed,
	  including its name and the byte offset of the bottom
	  line being displayed.  If possible, it also prints the
	  length of the file and the percent of the file above
	  the last displayed line.

     -	  Followed by one of the command line option letters (see
	  below), this will toggle the setting of that option and
	  print a message describing the new setting.

     +cmd Causes the specified cmd to be executed each time a new
	  file is examined.  For example, +G causes _l_e_s_s to ini-
	  tially display each file starting at the end rather
	  than the beginning.

     V	  Prints the version number of _l_e_s_s being run.

     q	  Exits _l_e_s_s.

     The following two commands may or may not be valid, depend-
     ing on your particular installation.

     v	  Invokes an editor to edit the current file being
	  viewed.  The editor is taken from the environment vari-
	  able EDITOR, or defaults to "vi".

     ! shell-command
	  Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given.

OPTIONS
     Command line options are described below.	Most options may
     be changed while _l_e_s_s is running, via the "-" command.

     Options are also taken from the environment variable "LESS".
     For example, if you like more-style prompting, to avoid typ-
     ing "less -m ..." each time _l_e_s_s is invoked, you might tell
     _c_s_h:

     setenv LESS m

     or if you use _s_h:

     LESS=m; export LESS

     The environment variable is parsed before the command line,
     so command line options override the LESS environment vari-
     able.  A dollar sign ($) may be used to signal the end of an
     option string.  This is important only for options like -P
     which take a following string.

     -s   The -s option causes consecutive blank lines to be
	  squeezed into a single blank line.  This is useful when
	  viewing _n_r_o_f_f output.

     -t   Normally, forward searches start just after the top
	  displayed line (that is, at the second displayed line).
	  Thus forward searches include the currently displayed
	  screen.  The -t option causes forward searches to start
	  just after the bottom line displayed, thus skipping the
	  currently displayed screen.

     -m   Normally, _l_e_s_s prompts with a colon.	The -m option
	  causes _l_e_s_s to prompt verbosely (like _m_o_r_e), with the
	  percent into the file.

     -M   The -M option causes _l_e_s_s to prompt even more verbosely
	  than _m_o_r_e.

     -P   The -P option provides a way to tailor the three prompt
	  styles to your own preference.  You would normally put
	  this option in your LESS environment variable, rather
	  than type it in with each less command.  Such an option
	  must either be the last option in the LESS variable, or
	  be terminated by a dollar sign.  -P followed by a
	  string changes the default (short) prompt to that
	  string.  -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt to the
	  string, and -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.  The
	  string consists of a sequence of letters which are



Printed 11/24/99						4






LESS(LOCAL)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LESS(LOCAL)



	  replaced with certain predefined strings, as follows:
	       F    file name
	       f    file name, only once
	       O    file n of n
	       o    file n of n, only once
	       b    byte offset
	       p    percent into file
	       P    percent if known, else byte offset
	  Angle brackets, < and >, may be used to surround a
	  literal string to be included in the prompt.	The
	  defaults are "fo" for the short prompt, "foP" for the
	  medium prompt, and "Fobp" for the long prompt.
	  Example: Setting your LESS variable to "PmFOP$PMFObp"
	  would change the medium and long prompts to always
	  include the file name and "file n of n" message.
	  Another example: Setting your LESS variable to
	  "mPm<--Less-->FoPe" would change the medium prompt to
	  the string "--Less--" followed by the file name and
	  percent into the file.  It also selects the medium
	  prompt as the default prompt (because of the first
	  "m").

     -q   Normally, if an attempt is made to scroll past the end
	  of the file or before the beginning of the file, the
	  terminal bell is rung to indicate this fact.	The -q
	  option tells _l_e_s_s not to ring the bell at such times.
	  If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used
	  instead.

     -Q   Even if -q is given, _l_e_s_s will ring the bell on certain
	  other errors, such as typing an invalid character.  The
	  -Q option tells _l_e_s_s to be quiet all the time; that is,
	  never ring the terminal bell.  If the terminal has a
	  "visual bell", it is used instead.

     -e   Normally the only way to exit less is via the "q" com-
	  mand.  The -e option tells less to automatically exit
	  the second time it reaches end-of-file.

     -u   If the -u option is given, backspaces are treated as
	  printable characters; that is, they are sent to the
	  terminal when they appear in the input.

     -U   If the -U option is given, backspaces are printed as
	  the two character sequence "^H".

	  If neither -u nor -U is given, backspaces which appear
	  adjacent to an underscore character are treated spe-
	  cially: the underlined text is displayed using the
	  terminal's hardware underlining capability.  Also,
	  backspaces which appear between two identical charac-
	  ters are treated specially: the overstruck text is

LESS(LOCAL)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LESS(LOCAL)



	  printed using the terminal's hardware boldface capabil-
	  ity.	Other backspaces are deleted, along with the
	  preceeding character.

     -w   Normally, _l_e_s_s uses a tilde character to represent
	  lines past the end of the file.  The -w option causes
	  blank lines to be used instead.

     -d   Normally, _l_e_s_s will complain if the terminal is dumb;
	  that is, lacks some important capability, such as the
	  ability to clear the screen or scroll backwards.  The
	  -d option suppresses this complaint (but does not oth-
	  erwise change the behavior of the program on a dumb
	  terminal).

     -p   Normally, _l_e_s_s will repaint the screen by scrolling
	  from the bottom of the screen.  If the -p option is
	  set, when _l_e_s_s needs to change the entire display, it
	  will clear the screen and paint from the top line down.

     -h   Normally, _l_e_s_s will scroll backwards when backwards
	  movement is necessary.  The -h option specifies a max-
	  imum number of lines to scroll backwards.  If it is
	  necessary to move backwards more than this many lines,
	  the screen is repainted in a forward direction.  (If
	  the terminal does not have the ability to scroll back-
	  wards, -h0 is implied.)

     -[z] When given a backwards or forwards window command, _l_e_s_s
	  will by default scroll backwards or forwards one
	  screenful of lines. The -z_n option changes the default
	  scrolling window size to _n lines.  If _n is greater than
	  the screen size, the scrolling window size will be set
	  to one screenful. Note that the "z" is optional for
	  compatibility with _m_o_r_e.

     -x   The -x_n option sets tab stops every _n positions.  The
	  default for _n is 8.

     -l   The -l option, followed immediately by a filename, will
	  cause _l_e_s_s to copy its input to the named file as it is
	  being viewed.  This applies only when the input file is
	  a pipe, not an ordinary file.

     -b   The -b_n option tells _l_e_s_s to use a non-standard buffer
	  size.  There are two standard (default) buffer sizes,
	  one is used when a file is being read and the other
	  when a pipe (standard input) is being read.  The
	  current defaults are 5 buffers for files and 12 for
	  pipes.  (Buffers are 1024 bytes.) The number _n speci-
	  fies a different number of buffers to use.  The -b may
	  be followed by "f", in which case only the file default



Printed 11/24/99						6






LESS(LOCAL)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      LESS(LOCAL)



	  is changed, or by "p" in which case only the pipe
	  default is changed.  Otherwise, both are changed.

     -c   Normally, when data is read by _l_e_s_s, it is scanned to
	  ensure that bit 7 (the high order bit) is turned off in
	  each byte read, and to ensure that there are no null
	  (zero) bytes in the data (null bytes are turned into
	  "@" characters).  If the data is known to be "clean",
	  the -c option will tell _l_e_s_s to skip this checking,
	  causing an imperceptible speed improvement.  (However,
	  if the data is not "clean", unpredicatable results may
	  occur.)

     +	  If a command line option begins with +, the remainder
	  of that option is taken to be an initial command to
	  _l_e_s_s. For example, +G tells _l_e_s_s to start at the end of
	  the file rather than the beginning, and +/xyz tells it
	  to start at the first occurence of "xyz" in the file.
	  As a special case, +<number> acts like +<number>g; that
	  is, it starts the display at the specified line number
	  (however, see the caveat under the "g" command above).
	  If the option starts with ++, the initial command
	  applies to every file being viewed, not just the first
	  one.	The + command described previously may also be
	  used to set (or change) an initial command for every
	  file.


BUGS
     When used on standard input (rather than a file), you can
     move backwards only a finite amount, corresponding to that
     portion of the file which is still buffered.  The -b option
     may be used to expand the buffer space.
